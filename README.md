# 👋 Hi, I’m Firas 
- 🔭 I’m working on real-world systems like ride-hailing apps, medical platforms, and secure backend services.
- 💻 I build full-stack software using **C#**, **Python**, **Flutter**, and **PostgreSQL** – with a focus on **performance**, **architecture**, and **data security**.
- 🌐 I deploy and manage solutions on **Linux VPS**, using tools like **WireGuard**, **Supabase**, **Stripe**, and **Cloudflare Tunnels**.
- 🔍 Currently learning **advanced C#/.NET WPF**, refining **Flutter architecture**, and building **distributed simulations**.
- 🌍 Languages: German 🇩🇪 | Arabic 🇸🇾 | English 🌎

> But with the right logic and the right tools – I try anyway.
